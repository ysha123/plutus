{-
Initialise a stateful `IO` function for loading core bindings by loading the
relevant `ModIface` from disk. Each interface that is loaded has its bindings
cached within an `IORef (ModuleEnv (Maybe (NameEnv (Bind CoreBndr))))`.

The current module doesn't have an interface file yet, so we recover its binds
from the `ModGuts` instead. However, since we're running this plugin early in
the core pipeline, the current module's binds won't have passed through the
core optimisation phases yet, so if we're inlining `Name`s from this module
we'll have to rely on the optimisations being run on our already inlined ASTs.

-- Interface loading for top-level bindings
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

{-
Certain RHSs fail to typecheck due to the error `Iface id out of scope: ...`.
In particular, this workaround is used to exclude GHC's special type reflection
bindings from causing problems in loading.

In theory, we should be removing them during serialisation, but they are structured
as real bindings, so we would have to do a fragile test on the `Name`.
